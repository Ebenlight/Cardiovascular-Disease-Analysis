# Cardiovascular-Disease-Analysis
This dataset contains records of 1,000 patients to analyze cardiovascular disease risk. Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, number of major vessels, and a target indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
##  Project Overview

This project analyzes a cardiovascular disease dataset to identify key risk factors associated with heart disease.  
The objective was to explore patient health metrics and determine which variables strongly influence the presence of heart disease (`target = 1`).

## Analysis Problem

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.  
This analysis aims to uncover patterns that could support early detection and better risk assessment.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Checked and handled missing values  
- Removed inconsistencies in categorical fields  
- Standardized column naming conventions  
- Converted appropriate columns to correct data types  
- Validated dataset integrity before analysis

##  Exploratory Analysis Questions

- What proportion of patients have heart disease?
- Does age significantly impact heart disease occurrence?
- Which chest pain type is most associated with heart disease?
- How do blood pressure and cholesterol influence risk?
- Does the number of major blood vessels increase likelihood?
